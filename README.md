# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: styles not applying correctly.

## Problem

The provided code snippet includes Tailwind CSS classes (`bg-red-500`, `p-4`) that are not rendering the expected styles.  The text should appear red and have padding, but it doesn't.

## Solution

The solution involves checking several aspects of your Tailwind CSS setup:

1. **Correct Configuration:** Ensure that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured in your project. Check your `tailwind.config.js` file to make sure the content path is correctly specified to include all the files where you are using Tailwind classes.
2. **Purge (or Content) Configuration:** If you're using the JIT mode, make sure that the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` includes the paths to all your template files.
3. **CSS Order:** The order in which your CSS files are loaded can impact class application. Ensure your Tailwind CSS is loaded after any conflicting stylesheets.
4. **Typographical Errors:** Double-check for any typos in your Tailwind class names.
5. **Build Process:** If you are using a build process (e.g., Webpack, Vite), ensure that your build process correctly processes Tailwind CSS.
6. **Conflicting Styles:** Check if other CSS rules might be overriding your Tailwind styles. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element and see which styles are applied and their precedence.  Check for conflicting styles from third-party libraries or custom CSS.

This repository provides a minimal example and a solution to help illustrate and fix this common problem. For more detailed information, refer to the official Tailwind CSS documentation.
